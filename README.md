# Tetris-OOP-Project-
Tetris game created using OOP fundamentals in C++ and SFML library for graphics.  

## Implementation
* This was a semester project where the goal was to use inheritance and polymorphism to implement tetrominoes. 
* The interaction between the tetrominoes uses basic collision checks.
* SFML textures have been used to load textures for the tetrominoes and the grid.
* A leaderboard has been implemented using simple text files to store the scores and names for the top 5 players.

## Functionality
* This is a tetris clone and implements all the basic features of the classic game.
* Enter your name at the starting screen and press enter to start the game.
* Left and right arrow keys are used to move the tetrominoes and up key is used to rotate them.
* The seven basic tetrominoes implemented with the essential rotaions for each.
* The game terminates when you reach the top of the grid and the leaderboard is displayed

## Run Locally
* Download the "TetrisFiles" folder and run the tetris.exe file in this folder to play the game.
* The "Source.cpp" file handles the main event loop and "classes.h" file implements the classes for the grid, tetromino, game etc.
